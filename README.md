## 📁 Repo Structure

Each folder contains a team member’s individual contribution or dataset


Each team member will work in their personal folder. Later, we’ll combine the work into a shared team feature.

---

## 🔧 Goal

To collaboratively build a shared feature that integrates data or visual elements from each member’s weather project — and showcase the power of teamwork!

---

## 🧠 How We'll Use This Repo

- Each person adds their code or data in their folder
- We’ll all contribute to a shared final feature (coming soon!)
- Git keeps track of everyone's updates so we can collaborate smoothly

---

## 🚀 Let’s Go Team 7!

We're ready to build something awesome — together. 💪
