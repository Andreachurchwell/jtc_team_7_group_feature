# 🌤️ Weather You Like It or Not – Team 7  
**Tech Pathways Capstone | TPS 2025**

Welcome to the official Team 7 repo! This is where we collaborate to build our shared capstone feature — integrating weather data from each of our hometowns into a single cohesive experience.

## 🗂️ Repo Structure

- Each team member has a personal folder containing their individual dataset or contribution.
- Final merged and cleaned dataset lives in the `shared_csv/` folder as:
  - `team_weather_data.csv` ✅

---

## 📊 Project Flow

1. Each member cleaned and pushed weather data from their city into their folder.
2. A master script (`team_csv.py`) combines all data into a single, uniform CSV file.
3. All temps were converted to Celsius and columns were standardized.
4. We’ll use the merged data for charts, dashboards, and other shared features in our personal projects.

## ⚙️ Shared Feature Goal

To showcase:
- Uniform structure
- Visualizations from each city
- Team collaboration through data

---

## 🔧 Notes

- Everyone’s original data is untouched and safe in their folders.
- The merged file was carefully cleaned for consistency (a few extra steps were needed for formatting).
- Once Merhanda’s file is submitted, it’ll be added to the final team CSV.
