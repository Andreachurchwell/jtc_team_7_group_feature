# 🌤️ Weather You Like It or Not – Team 7  
**Tech Pathways Capstone | TPS 2025**

Welcome to the official Team 7 repo! This is where we collaborate to build our shared capstone feature — integrating weather data from each of our hometowns into a single cohesive experience.

## 👥 Team Members

- **Andrea Churchwell** – `Andrea_C/`
- **Brett Coleman** – `Brett_C/`
- **Luis Venegas** – `Luis_V/`
- **Mark Hunter** – `Mark_H/`
- **Merhanda Parrish** – `Merhanda_P/`
- **Sarina Parrish** – `Sarina_P/`

## 🗂️ Repo Structure

- Each team member has a personal folder containing their individual dataset or contribution.
- The final merged and cleaned dataset lives in the `shared_csv/` folder as:
  - `team_weather_data.csv` ✅

---

## 📊 Project Flow

1. Each member cleaned and pushed historical weather data from their city into their folder.
2. A master script (`team_csv.py`) combines all files into a single, uniform CSV.
3. All temps were converted to **Celsius**, and columns were standardized for consistency.
4. The merged data will be used to generate charts, dashboards, or other shared visual features in each of our personal projects.

## 🎯 Team Feature Overview

For our team feature, each of us is using historical weather data from our hometowns, covering a full year. Even though we all live in different parts of the U.S., we agreed to use the same core parameters in our data:

- `date`  
- `city`  
- `min_temp`  
- `max_temp`  
- `precip`  
- `max_wind_spd`  

We’re using this shared structure so we can each create visuals using Matplotlib — however we want.

The goal is to let everyone explore their city’s weather trends in their own way, but still tie it all together through the same dataset and parameters. It’s one shared idea, just interpreted differently by each teammate.

For example, some of us are exploring interactive charts, trend lines, or comparing temps across cities on certain holidays — it’s flexible as long as it’s built from the same data.

## 🔧 Notes

- Everyone’s **original data is untouched** and still located in their respective folders.
- Luis and Sarina’s files required extra cleanup due to formatting issues (extra commas, mismatched parameters), but everything is now uniform.
- Once Merhanda’s file is submitted, it will be merged with the rest, and the updated version will be shared here.
